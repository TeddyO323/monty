## Monty

**The Monty language :**

Monty is a programming and scripting language. <br>
This language was designed by David A. Watt. <br>

---

**Usage :**

- monty file : where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code<br>

- If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message USAGE: monty file, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE.<br>

- If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message Error: Can't open file <file>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE<br>
  where <file> is the name of the file<br>

- If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE<br>
  where is the line number where the instruction appears.<br>
  Line numbers always start at 1<br>
- The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:<br>
  it executed properly every line of the file<br>
  it finds an error in the file an error occured<br>

- If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message Error: malloc failed, followed by a new line, and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.<br>

- You have to use malloc and free and are not allowed to use any other function from man malloc (realloc, calloc, …)<br>

**Operations :**
List of monty operations this interpreted understands:
- `push <integer>`: pushes an integer on to the stack
- `pall`: prints the values of every node on the stack
- `pint`: prints the value of the node at the top of the stack
- `pop`: removes the node at the top of the stack
- `swap`: swaps the position of the top two nodes
- `add`: places the sum of the top two nodes into the 2nd node and removes the
  first
- `sub`: subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack
- `div`: divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack
- `mul`: multiples the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack
- `mod`: computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack
- `pchar`: prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line
- `pstr`: prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line
- `rotr`:  rotates the stack to the bottom
- `rotl`: opcode rotate the stack to the top

**General :**<br>
    What do LIFO and FIFO mean?<br>

    FIFO stand for First In First Out

    LIFO stand for Last In First Out

***Compilation & Output :***

    typedef struct stack_s
        {
        int n;
        struct stack_s *prev;
        struct stack_s *next;
        } stack_t;


    typedef struct instruction_s
        {
        char *opcode;
        void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);
        } instruction_t;


---
***Compilation & Output :***

    Your code will be compiled this way :
        $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90 *.c -o monty
